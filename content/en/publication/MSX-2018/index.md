abstract: "Many musicians deliver prosocial messages in their music and engage in charity events, but we know very 
little about how our reception of this music affects us. Following the General Learning Model by Buckley and Anderson, 
one possible explanation could be that the music affects us because we know about the engagement and the intentions 
of the musicians. In most cases this knowledge is received through media coverage. Two studies were conducted to 
investigate what influence media coverage about music with prosocial content has on participants’ appraisal of the 
music, and the effect of the music on participants. The first study (N = 145) altered the valence of the media coverage 
about a semi-fictional music charity project in a 3 × 1 between-subjects design. The second study (N = 157) used music 
by an unknown artist that had either prosocial or comparable neutral lyrics alongside positive or neutral media coverage 
about the artist in a 2 × 2 between-subjects design. Both studies tested the extent to which participants’ appraisal of 
the music they listened to, their empathy and associated prosocial behavior or prosocial behavioral intentions differed 
between experimental groups. Results of Study 1 indicate that media coverage influences our appraisal as negative media 
coverage of the charity project was found to negatively affect participants’ appraisal of that project and Study 2 yielded 
that neutral media coverage of the unknown artist led to the most positive appraisal of the artist’s music."
