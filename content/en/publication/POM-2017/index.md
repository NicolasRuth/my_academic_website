abstract: "A significant amount of existing research has dealt with the negative effects of music on people’s behavior, 
but only a few studies have shown that music with prosocial lyrics can increase prosocial behavior. This study focuses 
on the positive effects of music with prosocial lyrics on people in an everyday setting. Based on the general learning 
model, a field experiment (N = 256, 66% female) was conducted to test whether people exposed to music with prosocial 
lyrics engaged in more prosocial behavior by buying more fair trade products compared to regular products than did those 
exposed to songs with neutral lyrics. Guests of a café were randomly assigned to either the prosocial or the neutral 
music condition and were monitored by two observers who were instructed to report the prosocial purchase (of fair trade 
coffee) and tipping behavior of the guests. The results indicated that there is a significant positive association 
between prosocial behavior and the prosocial lyrics of the songs played. The study shows that it is most likely that 
music with prosocial lyrics can influence one’s prosocial purchase behavior in an everyday situation. The underlying 
mechanisms are still poorly researched, but these findings support the theoretical assumptions."
